*AIRS* **P**ort**A**ble **C**ompression **E**ngine (*AIRSPACE*) is a
specialised compression library designed for the AIRS instrument aboard the
Ariel space telescope.
This library implements optimised compression algorithms tailored to the
instrument's scientific data processing.

[CAUTION]
.API unstable
====
The API interface is currently in development and may change in future versions.

== Features
* Optimised for AIRS scientific data
* Support for multiple compression configurations
* Comprehensive error handling with detailed error codes
* Portable:
** Written in ANSI C{empty}footnote:[With some extension: like inline or long long]
** Zero dynamic memory allocation (no internal `malloc()` calls)
* Command line utility

== Getting Started
You can get started with AIRSPACE in two ways: by using a pre-compiled release
or by building it from the source code.

=== Option 1: Use a Pre-compiled Release
The quickest way to start is by downloading a pre-compiled binary for your
operating system. This package includes both the `airspace` command-line tool
and the static library (`libcmp.a`).

TIP: https://github.com/uviespace/airs-compression/releases[*Download the latest release*]

=== Option 2: Build from Source
If you need the latest development features, want to contribute, or if a
pre-compiled release is not available for your platform, you can build the
project from source.
See the xref:INSTALL.adoc[INSTALL.adoc] Guide for detailed instructions on how to do it.

=== Examples
For quick implementation guidance, explore our collection of example code in
the link:examples/[`examples`] directory.

=== Command Line Interface
A command-line utility is available for compressing and decompressing AIRS data files.
See the xref:programs/README.adoc[CLI documentation] for details.
