= AIRS Data Compression
:toc: macro

The AIRS Data Compression is a specialised compression library designed for the AIRS instrument aboard the Ariel space telescope.
This library implements optimised compression algorithms tailored to the instrument's scientific data processing.

[CAUTION]
.API unstable
====
The API interface is currently in development and may change in future versions.
