= Installation Guide
:toc:

== Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools and dependencies installed.

=== Install Python 3.7+ and Git
On Linux, Python and Git are typically pre-installed.
On macOS and Windows, you can use the https://www.python.org/downloads[official Python installer].
Different options to install Git can be found https://git-scm.com/downloads[here].

=== Install Ninja
Ninja is a small build system with a focus on speed.
You should get Ninja using your https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/wiki/Pre-built-Ninja-packages[package manager]
or download the https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases[official release]
and put the `ninja` binary in your `PATH`.

=== Install Meson
Meson is an open source build system based on ninja meant to be both extremely
fast and, even more importantly, as user-friendly as possible.
Meson 0.63 or newer is required to build the different targets.
You can get meson through your package manager or by using pip:

[source,bash]
----
pip3 install --user meson
----

=== Verify Dependencies
To double-check if all dependencies are included in your `PATH`, run the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
git --version
python3 --version
meson --version
ninja --version
----
Ensure that each command returns a version number as expected.

=== Get the Source Code
Use the git version control system to get a copy of the source code.

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/uviespace/airs-compression.git airspace
cd airspace
----


== Setup the Build Environment
For every setup a separate directory is created for different build
configurations to keep things organized.
Everything we build will be inside this directory.

=== Debug Build Environment
Create a `build_debug` directory for debugging purposes, with no optimisations
and all warnings enabled:

[source,bash]
----
meson setup build_debug
cd build_debug
----

=== Release Build Environment
Setup a build directory optimized for release:

[source,bash]
----
meson setup build_release --buildtype=release
cd build_release
----

=== Configure Build Environment
Meson allows you to configure various build options.
Use `meson configure` to list all available options, and meson configure
`-D<option>` to set specific options.
Here's an example enabling Address and Undefined Behavior Sanitizers:

[source,bash]
----
# First, cd in a build directory
cd <name of the build directory>
meson configure -Db_sanitize=address,undefined
----
For more information on sanitizers, visit the
https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html[LLVM AddressSanitizer documentation].


== Build Different Targets
Once you have set up a build directory, you need to change to it (if you have
not already done so) and then build the software.

=== Build the Compression Library
To build the compression library, run:

[source,bash]
----
ninja lib/libcmp.a
----
The resulting library `cmplib.a` will be located in the `lib` folder of your build directory.

=== Build the AIRSPACE CLI
To build the xref:programms/README.adoc[CLI utility], run:

[source,bash]
----
ninja programs/airsapce
----
The `airspace` binary will be located in the `programs` folder of your build directory.

=== Build All Targets
To build all targets, simply run:

[source,bash]
----
ninja
----


== Testing

=== External dependencies
To run the unit tests you need a
https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation[Ruby interpreter], to
generate the test runners.

=== Run tests

[source,bash]
----
# First, cd in a build directory
cd <name of the build directory>

# Run all test
meson test

# List all available tests
meson test --list

# Run a single test
meson test <testname>

# Run a test under GDB
meson test --gdb <testname>
----

=== Producing a coverage report
Ensure that either `gcovr` or `lcov` is installed.

[source,bash]
----
# Enable coverage
cd <name of the build directory>
meson configure -Db_coverage=true

# Generate the coverage report
meson test  # or run the program you are interested in
ninja coverage-html

# If needed reset the coverage data
ninja clean-gcda
----

Find the report in the `meson-logs/coveragereport` subdirectory.
